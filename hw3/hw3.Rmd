## Q1 LA City Employee Payroll

The `/home/m280-data/la_payroll/LA_City_Employee_Payroll.csv` file on teaching server contains payroll information of LA City employees in years 2013-2017. It was downloaded from [LA City Controller's Office](https://controllerdata.lacity.org/Payroll/City-Employee-Payroll/pazn-qyym). Make a Shiny app to facilitate exploratory data analysis. 

1. For efficiency of the Shiny app, you should first pre-process, pare down, tidy, and save the data, e.g., as a compressed RDS file, to be used in the app.


0. **Total payroll by LA City**. Visualize the total LA City payroll of each year, with breakdown into base pay, overtime pay, and other pay.

0. **Who earned most?** Visualize the payroll information (total payment with breakdown into base pay, overtime pay, and other pay, Department, Job Title) of the top $n$ highest paid LA City employees in a specific year. User specifies $n$ (default 10) and year (default 2017).

0. **Which departments earn most?** Visualize the mean or median payroll, with breakdown into base pay, overtime pay, and other pay, of top $n$ earning departments. User specifies $n$ (default 5), year (default 2017), and method (mean or median, default median).

0. **Which departments cost most?** Visualize the total payroll, with breakdown into base pay, overtime pay, and other pay, of top $n$ expensive departments. User specifies $n$ (default 5) and year (default 2017).

0. Visualize any other information you are interested in.

## Q2 LA City Parking War

    ```{r}
    # load packages and datasets
    if (!"tidyverse" %in% rownames(installed.packages()))  
      install.packages("tidyverse", repos = "http://cran.rstudio.com/")
    if (!"DBI" %in% rownames(installed.packages()))

    ```

The SQLite database `/home/m280-data/la_parking/LA_Parking_Citations.sqlite` on teaching server contains information about parking tickets in LA City. It was downloaded from [LA Open Data Portal](https://data.lacity.org/A-Well-Run-City/Parking-Citations/wjz9-h9np). Connect to the database and answer following questions using plots and summary statistics. In this exercise, you are **not** allowed to load whole data into memory. Use the _transform in database, plot in R_ strategy.

    ```{r}
    db <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), dbname = 
                    "/home/m280-data/la_parking/LA_Parking_Citations_Extra.sqlite")
    dbListTables(db)
    #res <- dbSendQuery(db, "SELECT * FROM latix")
    #dbFetch(res)
    #dbDisconect(db)
    ```

1. How many tickets are in this data set? Which time period do these tickets span? Which years have most data?

    ```{r}
    latix_sql <- dplyr::tbl(db, "latix")
    latix_sql %>% print(width = Inf)
    
    latix_sql %>%
      summarise(n_distinct(Ticket_number))
    
    # including NA ticket numbers
    count(latix_sql)
    ```

    ```{sql connection=db}
    SELECT COUNT(Ticket_number) FROM latix
    ```

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    # using lubridate...does not work
    latix_sql %>% 
      select(Issue_Year, Issue_Month, Issue_Day, Issue_Hour, Issue_Minute) %>% 
      mutate(Issue_Time = make_datetime(Issue_Year, Issue_Month, Issue_Day, Issue_Hour, 
                                       Issue_Minute))
    
    test <- latix_sql %>% 
      select(Issue_Year, Issue_Month, Issue_Day) %>%
      mutate(Date = ymd(paste(Issue_Year, "-", Issue_Month, "-", Issue_Day, sep="")))
    head(test)
    ```

    ```{r}
    test <- latix_sql %>%
      filter(!is.na(Issue_Year)) %>%
      select(Issue_Year, Issue_Month, Issue_Day, Issue_Hour, Issue_Minute) %>%
      arrange(Issue_Year, Issue_Month, Issue_Day, Issue_Hour, Issue_Minute)
    head(test, 1) 
      
    test2 <- latix_sql %>%
      filter(!is.na(Issue_Year)) %>%
      select(Issue_Year, Issue_Month, Issue_Day, Issue_Hour, Issue_Minute) %>%
      arrange(desc(Issue_Year), desc(Issue_Month), desc(Issue_Day), 
              desc(Issue_Hour), desc(Issue_Minute))
    head(test2, 1)   

    #filter(row_number()==1 | row_number()==n()) %>%
    
    ```
